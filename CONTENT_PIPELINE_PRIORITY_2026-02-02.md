## SEO Strategy Integration

### Calculator as Content Hub

Each calculator should become a "spoke" in the content wheel:

```
     [Blog Post] ----┐
     [Blog Post] ----├---> [Calculator Page] <--- Pillar Page
     [Blog Post] ----┘           ↓
                           [Contact/Signup]
```

**Current state:** Calculators are destinations, but not hubs.

**Target state:** Calculators linked FROM blogs AND pillar pages, creating internal link strength.

### Keyword Targeting

Priority keywords for new calculator-linked posts:

**mydojo:**
- "how much does it cost to start a martial arts school" (High vol, low comp)
- "martial arts school revenue" (Med vol, med comp)
- "dojo profit margin" (Low vol, low comp - easy win)

**petcare:**
- "dog daycare profit margin" (Med vol, low comp)
- "pet boarding business income" (Med vol, med comp)

**mydriveschool:**
- "adi earnings calculator" (Med vol, LOW comp - EASY WIN)
- "driving instructor income uk" (High vol, med comp)
- "driving school profit margin" (Low vol, low comp)

**mytattoo:**
- "how much do tattoo artists make uk" (High vol, high comp)
- "tattoo artist income calculator" (Med vol, LOW comp - EASY WIN)
- "chair rental vs commission" (Med vol, low comp)

---

## Tools & Resources Needed

### Content Creation
- Excel content plan files (already exist - see below)
- Calculator feature documentation (for accurate writing)
- Industry benchmark data sources (for credibility)
- Competitor calculator analysis (see what they DON'T cover)

### Content Plan Files (Existing)
1. `mydojo.software/mydojo_content_plan.xlsx` - 33 planned posts
2. `petcare.software/petcare_content_strategy.xlsx` - 26 planned posts
3. `mydriveschool.software/content_plan_driving_school.xlsx` - 27 planned posts
4. `mytattoo.software/tattoo_content_plan.xlsx` - 30 planned posts

**Action Required:** Review these Excel files to identify which planned posts have calculator relevance. Prioritize those for writing.

### Analytics Setup
- UTM tracking (✅ DONE - 52 links tagged in this audit)
- GA4 custom events for calculator interactions
- Conversion funnels: Blog → Calculator → Contact

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Content Feels Repetitive
**Solution:** Focus on DIFFERENT angles:
- mydojo: Focus on membership models, retention
- petcare: Focus on capacity optimization, seasonality
- mydriveschool: Focus on utilization rates, hourly earnings
- mytattoo: Focus on booking rates, commission structures

Each site has unique calculator features to highlight.

### Risk: Calculator Linkage Feels Forced
**Solution:** Use natural transitions:
- "Want to model these numbers for your business? Use our [free calculator]"
- "Calculate your specific break-even point with our [calculator tool]"
- "See how these strategies impact your bottom line [calculator]"

Avoid: "Click here to use our calculator" (generic, salesy)

### Risk: Writers Unfamiliar with Calculators
**Solution:** Create "Calculator Content Brief" document:
- Screenshots of each calculator
- Key features to highlight
- Example CTAs that convert
- Do's and don'ts for calculator mentions

---

## Competitive Analysis (Recommended)

Analyze competitor calculator content strategies:

**Questions to answer:**
1. What blog topics do competitors link to their calculators?
2. How do they position calculator CTAs in content?
3. What calculator features do they emphasize?
4. What content gaps can we exploit?

**Recommended tool:** Ahrefs or SEMrush to analyze competitor blog → calculator internal links
